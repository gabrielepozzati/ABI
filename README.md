Codes for the final project of the course Algorithm for Bioinformatics

To produce the dataset, it is necessary to download all the pdb in pdb_list, put them in a folder called 'hotspot_pdb', create a folder called 'graphs' for the output and launch hotgraphextract.py

Once the dataset is ready, setup properly the paths and just run the pipeline in the jupyter file to reproduce the work.
